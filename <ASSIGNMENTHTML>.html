    “And now I see with eye serene <br>
    The very pulse of the machine <br>
    A being breathing thoughtful breath <br>
    A traveler betwixt life and death <br>
    The reason firm the temperate will <br>
    Endurance Foresight Strength and Skill” <br>
    
    ― William Wordsworth in The Very Pulse of the Machine by Michael Swanwick
